# Endeavor

Game based off of this Japanese proverb: “Life without endeavor is like entering a jewel-mine and coming out with empty hands”

## Game

You're a gem miner
You work in a mine for x company
This mine specializes in the acquisition of raw xxx
x company owns other mines too
If you perform well enough, you can be promoted within this mine
You can also choose to stay at your current job placement and move between mines 
This improves mining proficiency, as opposed to management expertise

From ^:

- Multiple geographic locations
- Multiple mining companies you could work for
- Many types of resources that can be mined
- Different skill sets:
  - Mining
  	- Increased chance of finding rare resources 
  - Machine Operation
  	- Increased gross output, but no finding of rare resources
  - Management
  	- Reliable cash flow, and less dangerous (danger is a difficult game mechanic to implement)
- Investment
  - Resource futures
  - Mining company stocks
- Wages and personal sale of rare resources
- Refinement
- Product sectors that require different kinds of resources


All of this is cool. But start with something reasonable. That reasonable thing is mining.


## Natural Resources

* The way I'm going to go about organizing geography will be a bit History of the World-esque, but that's in the interest of resources, not technology.
* Geographic distribution of resources will not be dependent on actual net availability / accessibility of resources. Rather, we'll take the simplistic view that each country has the same amount of a resources as other countries, and all resources are accessible to mining companies.
* Resource: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2111.html
* For the sake of simplicity, natural resources = inorganic compounds. That means no flora, fauna or energy
  * Long-dead flora / fauna is ok, peat (1000s of years) and oil (millions) is acceptable
* Decide whether I want to specify between bauxite and alumninum; same for ore vs metal. It might make sense to just say you're mining alumninum, and I could always change it back...




I should be able to pull the price of what's leftover from some futures indexes. If users don't know where they came from, I can just use past results; otherwise I can also try pulling that data from other sources
